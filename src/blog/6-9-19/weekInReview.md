This week I spent a lot of time working through Andrew Mead's The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp(2019) course on Udemy.  We started by going through the basics of the language such as variables, loops, functions, objects and other data types, and arrays.  After the basics, we started diving into browser specific JavaScript and DOM manipulation.  From there the course went over Data Storage (local storage) and how to use third party libraries in JavaScript.  Two projects we worked on throughout the course to help cover these topics we a note taking application and a todo app.  Most of the things I covered in this course this week were review for me, though it did help fill in some gaps, but as the course progresses, we will be covering more complex topics that are new to me.  I also spent time this week working on this blog site, improving my resume, and planning out starting a Youtube channel.

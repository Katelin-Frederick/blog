This week I continued working on Andrew Mead's The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp (2019) course on Udemy.  In the course this week we covered some of the features made available to us in ES6.  We learned about the syntax of arrow functions and the difference between them and regular functions.  The ternary operator was also discussed along with truthy and falsy values and type coercion.  Error handling and the use of strict mode was also covered.  Some of this was review for me but it greatly helped me understand these concepts on a deeper level and fill in some gaps in my knowledge.

I also started making slides for my html playlist on my youtube channel and began shooting some of the videos.  I am very excited to continue making content to grow my channel and see how far I can take it.  The possibility of being able to give back to the community that gave me so much through growing this channel is very exciting to me and something I look forward to.
